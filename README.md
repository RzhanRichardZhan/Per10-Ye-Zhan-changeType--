==========================

What is changeType()?

changeType() is a puzzle platformer originally created by Nitrome Limited.

The player has the ability to swap different blocks in order to get to the finish block.

The player may also swap enemies, coins, and even the finish line.


How to Play:

W - Jump

A - Move Left

D - Move Right

E - Undo Swap

Space - Swap

Not bugs:

* If an enemy is swapped with a block, that block IS SUPPOSE to maintain the enemy's movement.
* The cogwheel at the top right serves no purpose.

Known bugs:

COLLISIONS ARE VERY BUGGY

* The hit box for the spring strangely only uses the southeast point of the character
* You can hit a sweet spot between Steel or Dirt blocks to get an additional jump
* If you were to jump on a flying enemy that was swapped for a block that is standable, the player will constantly move up and down.
* Enemy hit detection is larger than may seem
* Blocks sometimes dont die when they're suppose to i.e: Bricks and blocks swapped with enemies
* Jumping up and down without directional influence will cause the player to shift 4 pixels towards the edge of the block the player is standing on.
